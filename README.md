# rust-challenges

These repository contains solution implementations of Rust challenge problems as set out in Stanford's cs140e course.
Some of these challenges are quite trivial whereas others really challenge your understanding of the language. Going through
these exercise implementations gave me enough confidence to move on to writing non-trivial rust programs.

## How to get started

Just clone the repository and go through the files in `challenge_problems`. The code itself has comments provided by the 
admin of the stanford course that will tell you what to do. They also provided a test script called `test.sh` which 
is executable. Just run `./test.sh` to check how many tests you managed to pass.
